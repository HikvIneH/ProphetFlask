we are more likely to drawn into a simple viewpoint.
we dont have to be realistic to live in this world, by that,
I mean in the most broad sense, and in the most narrow sense as well. 
like in evolution our senses dont have to be accurate for us to live and function in a world that we live in. 
it only needs to be relevant for us to survive, other than that, it just a waste of energy.
